### 22. October 2021 //BLACK VISIONS OF THE UNKNOWN: VIDEO RELEASE OF OUR SINGLE “GOD HELL”//
We are quite happy to tease you for our first video for the upcoming single “God Hell”, which was filmed by the director Martin Nefe in June, 2021. He and a bunch of artists (including yours truly RHIZONE) were crawling through the dirt and swimming in a deep, dark pond in the middle of the night to get us pictures, we couldn’t even have dreamed of before. Thanks a lot to the whole crew for making this unbelievably dark-sided music-video a part of our realities.	
It will be released together with the record “Timelines”, so check it out then!
